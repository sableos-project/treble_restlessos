# RestlessOS

RestlessOS is an **unofficial**, **unaffiliated** fork of
[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org) packaged as a Generic System Image (GSI)
for Project Treble devices. It is not endorsed by, sponsored by, or in any way
connected to the GrapheneOS project or its developers.

## Changes from GrapheneOS

GrapheneOS targets Pixel devices with known hardware. A GSI must run on
arbitrary vendor partitions, so several hardening features are disabled or
made optional to avoid boot loops, crashes, or broken vendor drivers.

### Not included — inherent GSI limitations

A GSI ships only a system image; device-specific components come from the
vendor partition. The following GrapheneOS features cannot be provided by
any GSI:

- **firmware updates** — GrapheneOS ships firmware updates for Pixels alongside OS updates; RestlessOS uses whatever firmware the vendor partition provides
- **kernel updates** — GrapheneOS ships patched kernels for Pixels; RestlessOS boots the vendor kernel
- **driver and userspace HAL updates** — device-specific binaries cannot be bundled in a generic system image
- **GrapheneOS kernel hardening** — GrapheneOS's kernel patches target Pixel kernels specifically and cannot be applied to arbitrary vendor kernels

### Features removed
- **hardened_malloc** — causes boot loops on devices with 39-bit virtual address space. replaced with AOSP Scudo.
- **Auditor** — requires hardware attestation which doesn't work on GSI
- **mtectrl / misctrl** — Pixel-specific memory tagging control; breaks vendor TEE drivers
- **USB protection** — the low-level USB port controls rely on Pixel-specific hardware and are non-functional on other devices
- **native debugging protection** — not ported; breaks compatibility with root solutions and vendor debugging tools

### Features disabled by default

These can be re-enabled in **TrebleApp → Hardening** or **Settings → Exploit protection**.
- **MTE/TBI for vendor processes** — memory tagging breaks some vendor drivers
- **hardened thread stacks** — non-standard memory layout breaks some vendor drivers
- **secure (exec-based) app spawning** — breaks root solutions (Magisk / KernelSU)


## Delta Updates with zsync2

Each release includes a `.zsync` file alongside the uncompressed `.img`,
enabling delta downloads via [zsync2](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/zsync2).
Only the changed blocks are downloaded, saving significant bandwidth on
incremental updates.

```sh
zsync2 <url to .zsync file> -i <full path to previous .img file>
```

For example:

```sh
zsync2 https://build.chrisaw.io/RestlessOS-ab-16-202603261200/zsync/RestlessOS-arm64-ab-16-202603261200.img.zsync \
    -i ~/Downloads/RestlessOS-arm64-ab-16-202603201400.img
```

> **Note:** point `-i` at the uncompressed `.img` file, not the `.img.xz`
> archive. If you only have the `.xz`, decompress it first with
> `xz -dk <file>.img.xz`.

## Known Issues

### MediaTek BPF bug (kernel 4.14 / 4.19)

Some MediaTek devices running kernel 4.14 or 4.19 have a vendor kernel
patch ([ALPS05247589]) that breaks BPF array map updates. The patch adds
an incorrect bounds check to `array_map_update_elem` which silently
skips the `memcpy`, causing BPF map writes to be dropped without error.

This affects Android's BPF-based networking stack, including the firewall
and RestlessOS's per-app network permission. Symptoms include apps
appearing to have no internet access despite being allowed, or firewall
rules not taking effect.

**This cannot be fixed from the GSI** — the bug is in the vendor kernel
binary. To fix it, patch the kernel using
[mtk-bpf-patcher](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/mtk-bpf-patcher) by
R0rt1z2. There is also an [APK version](https://github.com/Osanosa/ThemedManager/raw/refs/heads/main/mtk-bpf-patcher/release/mtk-bpf-patcher-release.apk)
that applies the same patch on-device (untested by us — use at your own
risk). See the [XDA thread](https://xdaforums.com/t/mtk-4-14-kernel-bpf-patching.4717277/)
for more information and discussion.
